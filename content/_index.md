Hello! :wave: I'm Venu, a Senior Software Engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I specialize in developing tools and pipeline that empower artists to create digital visual effects for film and television. At [Weta FX](https://www.wetafx.co.nz), my current focus is with the Creatures Department, where I help bring hyperrealistic characters in epic fantasies like [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630029/) and [Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389872/) to life. You can read about my career and journey into the VFX industry [here]({{< ref "/about/index.md" >}}).

I envision this website as a hybrid space, blending my professional work and personal projects with my interests in investing, travel, books, and podcasts, alongside various musings on life.

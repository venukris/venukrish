With over two decades of experience in the animation and visual effects industry, my career has taken me from a character rigger in my early years to my current role as a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Weta FX](https://www.wetafx.co.nz) in New Zealand. In this role, I've been building and maintaining a procedural creature simulation and baking pipeline, and applications that empower Creature TDs to deliver hyperrealistic creatures.

Iâ€™ve worked at studios globally, including [Base FX](https://www.base-fx.com/) (China) as a Lead Pipeline Technical Director, [Animal Logic](https://animallogic.com/) (Australia) as a Performance Technical Director, and [Dreamworks](https://www.dreamworks.com/)/[Technicolor](https://www.technicolor.com/) (US/India) as a Senior Technical Director. In these roles, I contributed to multiple departments towards delivering many feature animation films.

I am passionate about pipeline design and development, constantly learning about new technologies and the creative challenges they help solve. I enjoy collaborating with dynamic teams to explore and create innovative solutions that impact creative quality and production efficiency, and helping fellow colleagues succeed.

After hours, I enjoy watching films and TV shows, keeping fit and healthy, reading, listening to podcasts, and spending time with family. I also enjoy traveling, cooking and coffee art!

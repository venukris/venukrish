## My VFX Journey

My career in the film, animation, and visual effects industry spans **over two decades**, rooted in my **Computer Science engineering** background. It all began in 2003 as an animator and character rigger at **Paprikaas** in Bengaluru, where I contributed to various kids’ TV shows.

In 2005, a growing interest in character rigging led me to [Prana Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana_Studios) in Mumbai to work on Disney’s *[Tinker Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell_(film_series))* film series. Over three years, I advanced from a developer specializing in rigging tools to a **Rigging Lead** on various shows, ensuring consistent quality rigs within production timelines. I culminated my time there as **Head of Rigging**, managing a team of 16.

In 2009, I transitioned to [DreamWorks](https://www.dreamworks.com/)' unit at Technicolor India as a **Technical Director**. I was primarily involved with the Crowds department, where I provided frontline technical support to artists while also building and maintaining the studio's production pipeline and tools. Additionally, I collaborated with creative leads and technology teams to establish new techniques and workflows to address show-specific challenges on films like *[Penguins of Madagascar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1911658/)* and *[Madagascar 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1277953/)*.

My international career began in 2015 when I moved to **[Animal Logic](https://animallogic.com/)** in Sydney, Australia. As a **Technical Director**, I was responsible for developing an array of workflow tools and integrating in-house core technology into production pipeline for the Layout, Assembly, and Animation teams on [The Lego Ninjago Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3014284/) and [The Lego Batman Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4116284/).

Subsequently, in 2017, I became a **Lead Pipeline Technical Director** at **[Base FX](https://www.base-fx.com/)** in Xiamen, China, where I was instrumental in establishing the pipeline for their first feature animation, [Wish Dragon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5562070/). My key contribution was to develop the Crowds pipeline and supporting tooling from the ground up, integrating the [Atoms Crowd](https://atoms.toolchefs.com/) plugin for Maya for authoring and simulating crowds.

Finally, in 2019, I joined **Weta Digital** (now **[Weta FX](https://www.wetafx.co.nz)**) in Wellington, New Zealand. As a **Creature Pipeline TD** and **Senior Software Engineer** for the past six years, I've been integrating various in-house frameworks and simulation solvers into the creature asset build, simulation and baking pipeline while also writing applications for Creatures Department. The result is a pipeline that facilitates efficient creation of realistic creatures for numerous visual effects movies and TV shows such as [Rise of the Planet of the Apes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/), [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630029/) and the upcoming [Avatar: Fire and Ash](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1757678/).
